# 💻 Local Development

To run this project locally:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/jasonevensen/terminal-coffee.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd terminal-coffee`
3. Open `index.html` in your browser or use a local server:
- On Linux you can use a simple python web server: `python3 -m http.server 9500`
- You can also use Node.js if you have http-serve installed: `npx http-server'
- You can also run a live server if you run VS-code
- Then you can just visit `http://localhost:9500` I like using port 9500 but you can make this anything you want. Default is port 8000

# 📝 Lessons Learned

- Working with CSS Grid and Flexbox for complex layouts
- Managing state in vanilla JavaScript
- Creating smooth user interactions without libraries
- Responsive design best practices
- Not copy-pasting code so I know what the site is actually doing
- Running a local light weight http server
- Using Vim instead of VS-code and Copilot to force myself to learn web dev concepts
- Using Git as version control and pushing the project to Github like you would when working on a real project.
